# HashMap & LinkedHashMap

## Description

This project provides `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap` classes that works both on **Node.js** and the **browser**.

*   They are both implementations of a simplified [HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) like [hash trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree_\(persistent_data_structure\))
*   It uses a modified [Murmer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) algorithm for generating hashes. This ensures the widest possible spread across all buckets.
*   As per spec, the basic `Hashmap` is not guaranteed to meet order of insertion when iterating over it. If you want guaranteed insertion order when iterating, use `LinkedHashMap`.
*   The keys are truly typed and unique, this means 1 !== "1".

### Choose your map wisely.

*   When choosing a collection it is worth understanding the problem you are trying to solve.
*   [Native JS Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) for small numbers of entries, will be significantly faster.
*   However once the map reaches 1'000 or more the Mootable Hashmap really shows its strengths. It utilizes more memory, to do this.
*   The [Native JS Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) is likely to have improved speed characteristics if repeating operations in a loop, via things such as JIT compilation. It is worth benchmarking to see if Map works better for you in those situations.

## Installation

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/@mootable/hashmap.png?compact=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/@mootable/hashmap)

Using [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/@mootable/hashmap):

    $ npm install @mootable/hashmap

You can download the last stable version from the [releases page](https://github.com/mootable/hashmap/releases).

If you like risk, you can download the [latest master version](https://raw.github.com/mootable/hashmap/master/hashmap.js), it's usually stable.

To run the tests:

    $ npm test

To run the benchmarks: (Ensure you have the memory to run them)

*   If you don't you can reduce the memory size (in MB) accordingly `--max_old_space_size` and remove the last items in `MAP_SIZES`

    $ node  --max_old_space_size=24576 --expose-gc test\benchmark.js

## Benchmarks

*   Current Benchmarks can be found under benchmark_results.
    *   The default benchmark does a single set, get and delete against a hashmap of a specific size. It does this thousands of times, and finds an approximate average.
    *   If you would like me to include your library for benchmarking, raise an issue in github.
        *   It must be in NPM
        *   It must have an identical interface to JS Map
        *   It must be fully written in JS. (Transpiling is acceptable) So that we can guarantee it works in the browser, not just node.

### Benchmarks on version 1.0.2

## Background

*   This repository is a reimplemented version of the [npm hashmap](https://npmjs.org/package/hashmap) repository. It takes that implementation as a starting point, and moves it closer to the core functionality hashmaps are designed to achieve.
*   The tests have remained mostly the same, as has some documentation, everything else has changed. The interfaces have now diverged.
